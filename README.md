## Description

[Link to Deployed Site](https://james-hunter-portfolio.netlify.app/)

This project was made for me to show the work I've done as a Full Stack Developer. The front-end of this project was in react. This taught me a lot about how to organize files for react as well as pass information through to other files. This includes using react states to update the site without the user having to refresh the page. This also taught me how to use conditional rendering for when certain events happen on the page.
